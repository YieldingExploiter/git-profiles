# Profile-Based Git init & Git clone

Need to manage multiple GitHub/GitLab/Gitea Users with different SSH Keys?<br/>
Want to take a break of constantly running `git config user.name/user.email whatever`?<br/>
Well this project is for you!

Am I gonna tell you how to use it? Maybe later, cba rn. The above is just my use-case & whatnot :shrug:<br/>
It's pretty self explanatory if you clone the repo

[profiles/example.json](profiles/example.json) will generate 1 file in your `$HOME/.bin`/`%USERPROFILE%\.bin`: `example-git` - To use it to clone, use `example-git YieldingExploiter/GitProfiles` - To init/config an existing repo, use `example-git` by itself. Both will first clone the repo, then git config it.


To generate executables based on profiles, run [`pnpm i`](https://pnpm.io), then `node generate-scripts.js`

### ssh agent

> This requires the optional dependency `ps-node`. `pnpm i` will automatically install it by default.<br/>
> All options related to this will be ignored if `ps-node` isn't installed.<br/>
> ***This option won't work on Windows.***

If you want to automatically spawn `ssh-agent` to save your SSH key's credentials, simply set your profile's `sshKey` to the path of the SSH Key.<br/>
If we cannot find an existing `ssh-agent` running, we will spawn a new one.

> *The example includes this option. Remove it if you wish to not have ssh-agent functionality.*

#### securely storing shit

By default, we store SSH Agent Socket Information in a file encrypted using a key generated by [generate-scripts](./generate-scripts.js) on compilation.

This isn't ideal; you should specify a `PROFILE_HELPER_KEY` & a `PROFILE_HELPER_IV` in your environment variables.<br/>
You should specify them as such in your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`:
```bash
export PROFILE_HELPER_KEY=$(tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 < /dev/urandom | head -c 4096 | xargs)
export PROFILE_HELPER_IV=$(tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 < /dev/urandom | head -c 4096 | xargs)
```

If you don't have those 2 variables present in your environment, you will receive a warning when saving/loading the SSH Agent's Socket Information, telling you to add those.

With these present, you will have one SSH Agent per terminal, as these variables are generated on shell open.

### submodules
if you specify `submod` as the first argument, it will act as `git submodule add <...>` - example: `example-git submod /GitProfiles`

### auto-clone
if your first argument includes a `:` or a `/`, it is assumed to be for `git clone`. Otherwise, it is assumed that you specified the git subcommand (excluding for `submod`&`sm`; `submodule` is still treated as a command where you specify what to do).

A blank command (`example-git`) is assumed to be `git init`.

> We don't assume everything is a clone as to allow git push/pull/whatever to use an [ssh-agent](#ssh-agent) started by us.
>
> If we don't detect an init, submod (NOT git submodule), or commit, we do not print `Configured Git as {profile.name}` after running the configuration commands. 

### notes
cloneName can either be `user@domain` or an SSH Config Name.<br/>
`preConfig`s are applied during clone using `--config` added to the command.<br/>
conigs are applies post-clone by using `git config` in the repository.

if the repo route starts with `/`, the config's `repoRoute` key will be prepended to it

`$HOME/.bin` or `%USERPROFILE%\.bin` must be in your `PATH` (instructions: [Linux](https://www.howtogeek.com/658904/how-to-add-a-directory-to-your-path-in-linux/) | [MacOS](https://techpp.com/2021/09/08/set-path-variable-in-macos-guide/) (untested) | [Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44272416/how-to-add-a-folder-to-path-environment-variable-in-windows-10-with-screensho))
