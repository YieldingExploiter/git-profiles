# Profile-Based Git init & Git clone

Need to manage multiple GitHub/GitLab/Gitea Users with different SSH Keys?<br/>
Want to take a break of constantly running `git config user.name/user.email whatever`?<br/>
Well this project is for you!

Am I gonna tell you how to use it? Maybe later, cba rn. The above is just my use-case & whatnot :shrug:<br/>
It's pretty self explanatory if you clone the repo

[profiles/example.json](profiles/example.json) will generate 1 file in your `$HOME/.bin`/`%USERPROFILE%\.bin`: `example-git` - To use it to clone, use `example-git YieldingExploiter/GitProfiles` - To init/config an existing repo, use `example-git` by itself. Both will first clone the repo, then git config it.


To generate executables based on profiles, run [`pnpm i`](https://pnpm.io), then `node generate-scripts.js`

### notes
cloneName can either be `user@domain` or an SSH Config Name.<br/>
`preConfig`s are applied during clone using `--config` added to the command.<br/>
conigs are applies post-clone by using `git config` in the repository.

if the repo route starts with `/`, the config's `repoRoute` key will be prepended to it

`$HOME/.bin` or `%USERPROFILE%\.bin` must be in your `PATH` (instructions: [Linux](https://www.howtogeek.com/658904/how-to-add-a-directory-to-your-path-in-linux/) | [MacOS](https://techpp.com/2021/09/08/set-path-variable-in-macos-guide/) (untested) | [Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44272416/how-to-add-a-folder-to-path-environment-variable-in-windows-10-with-screensho))
